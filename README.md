# 🧬 TensorTrapX (mh): Deep Diagnostic Engine for Breast Cancer Resilience

A hybrid, nonlinear machine learning framework built to detect and study breast cancer in a commercial-grade, production-ready format. Powered by TensorFlow, enhanced with noisy feature simulation, and designed to serve as a critical learning sandbox.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**TensorTrapX (mh)** introduces artificially noisy and realistic features into a breast cancer dataset and explores cutting-edge ML strategies to overcome feature ambiguity, simulate mislabeling traps, and build robust cancer prediction models.

This project was built with research, deployment, and commercial adaptation in mind. It follows a 4-phase strategy that allows flexible expansion from baseline modeling to deep AI and live monitoring.

## 🧠 4-Phase Strategy

### ✅ Phase 1: Baseline Modeling
- Use classical models (XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Inject synthetic features (e.g., processed_food, veg_diet)
- Simulate label influence (probabilistic cancer flipping)

### 🔍 Phase 2: TensorFlow + Noisy Data Challenges
- Deep models with TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluate noise resistance and nonlinear modeling
- Benchmark vs. classical ML

### ♻️ Phase 3: Continuous Learning + Explainability
- Incremental learning and label correction
- SHAP or Grad-CAM explainers
- Live model training with feedback

### 🌐 Phase 4: Deployment & Threat Simulation
- Streamlit or Flask API with model switching
- User input + prediction dashboards
- Add simulated attack (e.g., adversarial samples, mislabel injection)
