# TensorTrapX (mh): Deep Diagnostic Engine for Breast Cancer Resilience

This project explores the detection of breast cancer using complex, noisy, nonlinear datasets processed with TensorFlow. It simulates real-world conditions with custom binary lifestyle features (e.g., food habits, workouts) to enhance predictive robustness.

## Key Objectives
- Learn to extract signal from noise in large, raw medical datasets
- Apply advanced EDA, preprocessing, and TensorFlow-based modeling
- Develop commercial-scale diagnostic insight engines

## Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: EDA and modeling notebooks
- `scripts/`: Supporting Python modules
- `models/`: Trained pipelines and artifacts
